Making my first game

The initial assets were taken from Tech With Tim's game creation video on YouTube. I have made some additions to the game such as a charged bullet as well as a settings page to see how to move each ship. Next thing I want to add is a rocket/grenade option that has an AOE effect to it, I think that would be cool.
